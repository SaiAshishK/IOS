    == Task 1 ==
    In the first task you have to create a initial version of a web server
    to accept connections from HTTP clients and
    sends a HTTP response with a text message
    "Tiny HTTP Server is Under Construction..."

    This programming task recommends the use of OOP python.
    The guide that is given below follows OOP. It is understandable if you choose not to use OOP.
    The test harness that verifies your program would still work for non OOP solutions.
    
    The following are the high level steps that will help you to complete the task
    For more detailed explanation for these steps go to the references section below.
    There are references to tutorials that explain details if you need to learn.

    1. Create a python class to represent a HTTP server
    
    2. Initialize the constructor with IP and port as parameters
        2.1 In the constructor, create a socket and bind it with the given IP and port
        2.2 Servers are supposed to run forever, so start an infinite loop
        2.3 accept client connections
        2.4 For the first version create a HTTP response to the client with the body 
            "<h1>Webserver Under construction</h1>"
            2.4.1 Set the HTTP headers:
                    Content-Type to text/html
                    Content-Length to the length of the content in bytes
                    Connection to close
            2.4.2 Send the HTTP response to the client

    In the main function, instantiate the HTTP Server object.

    Test your program by opening the web browser and pointing the url to
    http://IP:port that are passed to the constructor.
    You should see the text Tiny HTTP Server is Under Construction...
    Use the browsser's developer tools to verify if all the headers set are as specified

    Common errors to look for:
    Constructing the HTTP Response with the correct headers is tricky
